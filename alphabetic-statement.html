<section id="alphabetic-statement">
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong> increasingly large and diverse audiences require and benefit from varied perspectives and constructions</p>
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong>  transmodality creates more access points into our work and our ideas in ways that benefit both audiences and composers</p>
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong>  audiences and composers with disabilities have diverse needs and transmodal composition is necessary to meet those needs</p>
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong>  accessibility shouldn't mean substandard access or lack of richness and complexity</p>
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong>  technology affords us a broad diversity of options and opportunities for composing in new, different, and multiple modes, and transmodality helps us practice and develop these new literacies</p>
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong> adaptation, interpretation, translation, and retelling have always been powerful discursive acts that can be uniquely invoked by transmodality </p>
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong> intellectual property and copyright culture have worked to stifle these discursive acts, and transmodality creates the potential to liberate composers from those limitations</p>
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong> transmodality allows us to reimagine and recreate in ways that transcend traditional concepts of mimesis and reproduction </p>
	<p><strong>BECAUSE</strong> teaching transmodality supports multimodal composition pedagogy by developing an understanding of the relationship between modes and the ability to move comfortably between them</p>
	<p><strong>We must teach transmodality; we must compose with transmodality; we must study transmodality; we must respect and value transmodality; and we must explore and experiment with transmodality; we need to emphasize transmodality’s importance in our life and our future.</strong> </p>
